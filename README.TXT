TRILLESKA / RALK

RALK is a rewrite of MALK (another TRILLESKA project) in the Rust programming language.

This was just made so I could learn Rust, primarily because I was bored. I am no longer bored.

Code is aptly commented, partly because it's good practice, and because I'm still figuring out Rust.
